The way this will work is that the user will send a command
in a discord channel to set up a repository.

The bot will provide a link with a code at the end that you have to paste in the webhooks
of the github repository.

The code at the end will be the id of that repository set up in 
the database

when the user calls the set up command the bot will record
the channel it should be posting the updates in and the id
of the discord server

when github makes requests to this url through webhooks it will
find that repository in its database, and post the update in the
designated channel on the designated server.
